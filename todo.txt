check car functions
    check is car id in ballot system is the same 
    change car details and delete car functionalities

understand why for select car by plate where there is one where Car id is not null (see controller.js 134 vs 225) 
    one more instance at line 241

add ballot functionalities
    add ballot status ("already joined", "havent joined")
    add next ballot status ("next ballot in xx:xx:xx")

fix dashboard UI
    have a place to show me all the student details 
    maybe remove add car button if there is a car already added vice versa
