add ballot functionalities
    during ballot 
        those who win should have a havePermit column set to true 
    after ballot is run 
        clear ballot table 
        set inBallot value back to false 
            UPDATE students
            SET inBallot = false; 

fix dashboard UI
    have a place to show me all the student details 
    maybe remove add car button if there is a car already added vice versa
    add ballot status ("already joined", "havent joined")
    add next ballot status ("next ballot in xx:xx:xx") 

Questions:
should i seperate the balloting code into different files since its a different process?
    if so how much of it should i seperate? (error handling stays in controller.js or ballot)

In process:
