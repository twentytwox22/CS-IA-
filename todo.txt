have a place to show me all the student details 
check car functions
    FIX ADD CAR PROBLEM
    check is car id in ballot system is the same 
tidy up sql statements + FK PK thingo 
understand why for select car by plate where there is one where Car id is not null (see controller.js 134 vs 225) 
    one more instance at line 241

fix bugs arising from the prefilled form 
add current car details
add functionalities for change car details and delete car buttons 

add ballot status ("already joined", "havent joined")
add next ballot status ("next ballot in xx:xx:xx")

fix dashboard UI
maybe remove add car button if there is a car already added vice versa 

Questions:
how to get around bugs arising from the prefilled form 

In process:
Tidying up Controller.js -- shifting SQL logic to querires.js -- inline comments 

DONE: 
add error handling for letting users add more than one car (3/5/24)
add current car details (4/5/24)
added additional error handling for "enterballot" function: check if the student has an existing car before allowing them to enter (4/5/24)
tidied up routes.js file (5/5/24)
Enhanced Error Handling (checks if student year is 11 or 12, checks if student ID is only numbers) (5/5/24)
Fixed bug where form isnt pre filled when error occurs (5/5/24)
